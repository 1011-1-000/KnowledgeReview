### Cost of capital for a project

When estimating the cost of equity with CAPM approach, beta(β) must be estimated

- For publicly traded company, estimation of the company's stock beta(β) is not a problem: market model regression, but this β is only applicable to the average-risk projects of the company
- For non-publicly traded company,estimation of the company's stock β is challenging

Factors affecting the β of a company's stock:
- Systematic components of business risk: Sales risk - risk related to the uncertainty of revenues; Operating risk: risk attributed to fixed cost of operation.
- Financial risk: risk attributed to fixed cost of financing(eg.interest of debt)

Pure-play method: Using a publicly traded comparable company's stock β(equity,comp) and adjusting it for financial leverage differences to estimate stock β(equity,project) for a project or company that is not publicly traded

> Comparable company: a company with similar business risk,generally a company in the same industry that is that single line of business(pure-play)

#### 4 Steps of pure-play method

- Select the comparable company(public traded, similar business risk)
- Estimate comparable's stock β(equity, comp)
- Un-lever the comparable's stock beta, remove the effects of financial leverage, then have the comparable's asset β(asset, comp.)
- Re-lever the asset β, then we have the project's stock β(equity, project)

Un-lever:
β(asset) = β(equity) * [1/(1+(1-t)D/E)]

Re-lever:
β(equity) = β(asset) * [1 + (1-t)D/E]

D/E: debt to equity ratio
