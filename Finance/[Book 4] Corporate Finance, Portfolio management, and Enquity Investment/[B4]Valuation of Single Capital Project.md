### Valuation of Single Capital Project

Valuation methods for single project

#### Net present value(NPV)

The sum of the present value of all the after-tax cash flows(with sign) of the project

NPV indeicates the expected change in the value of the firm
- Investment decision criteria(for single/independent project):if NPV > 0, then accept/invest; if NPV < 0, then reject/not invest.
- Advantages: Directly reflects the expect change of firm's value
- Disvantages: Ignore the size of the project

#### Internal Rate of Return(IRR)

The discount rate that makes the total present value of all cash flows, the NPV, equal to zero.

It is the expected return on the project.
- Investment decision criteria: if IRR > cost of capital, then accept/invest, if IRR < cost of capital, then reject/not invest
- Advantages: It reflects the profitability
- Disadvanatges:Multiple and no ERR problem, Impractical assumption of reinvestment rate(IRR)

projecct cash flow types:
- Conventional cash flows: cash flows change signs once
- Nonconventional cash flows: cash flows change signs more than once

For projects with nonconventional cash flows, there may be multiple IRRs or no IRR.

#### Payback Period(PB,回收期限)

The number of years required to recover the original investment in a project

> PB = A + B/C

A: the last period with negative ccumulative cash flow

B: The absolute value of cumulative cash flow at the end of the period A

C: The cash flow during the period after A

- Investment decision criteria: No decision rule like that of the NPV or IRR
- Advantages: Simple and reflects the liquidity
- Disadvanatges: No a measure of value or profitability, Ignores time value of money and the risk of the project, Ignores cash flows beyond the payback period.

#### Discount Payback Period(DPB)

The number of years it takes for the cumulative discounted cash flows from a project to equal the original investment.

> DPB = A + B/C

A: the last period with negative cumulative discounted cash flow

B: The absolute value of cumulative discounted cash flow at the end of the period A

C: The discounted cash flow during the period after A

Discounted payback period always greater than the payback period
- Investment decision criteria: No decision rule like that of the NPV or IRR
- Advantages: Simple and reflects the liquidity， Account for the time value of money and risk within the discounted payback period.
- Disadvanatges: No a measure of value or profitability, Ignores cash flows beyond the payback period.

#### Profitability Index(PI)

Present value of future cash flows divided by initial investment

> PI = PV of Future CF/CF0 = 1 + NPV/CF0

It indicates the value you are receiving in the exchange for one unit of currency invested.

- Investment decision criteria: if PI > 1, then accept/invest, if PI < 1 then reject/not invest
- Advantage: It measures the profitability, It directly shows the amount of value created per unit of investment
- Disadvantage: The absolute NPV is ignored
