##### Principles of Capital Budgeting

The after tax incremental cash flows provide a sound basis for capital budgeting. it involves basic principles as follows:

Include:
- Opportunity costs: the foregone return of the resource invests in the next-best project.
- Externalities: cannibalization(利益侵蚀)(negative effect);synergy(协同效应)(positive effect)

Exclude:
- Sunk costs(沉没成本)：decisions should not be affected by sunk costs
- Financing costs: they are considered in discount rate(avoiding double counting problem)

Time value of cash flow is crucial.
