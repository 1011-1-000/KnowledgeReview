### Cost of Debt,Preferred stock and Equity

#### Cost of debt

##### YTM approach

Yield to maturity(YTM,kd) is the annual return that an investor earns on a bond if the investor purchases the bond today and holds it until maturity.

> P0 = PMT/(1 + YTM)^1 + PMT/(1 + YTM)^2 + ... + FV/(1 + YTM)^n

After-tax cost is the true effective cost of debt to the company since interest payments are generally tax-deductible.

> After-tax cost of debt = kd(1-t)

##### Debt-rating approach

When a reliable current market price for a company's debt is not available, the debt-rating approach can be used to estimate the before-tax cost of debt

Using the yield(kd) on **comparably rated** bonds for **maturities that closely match** that of the company's existing debt.

> After-tax cost of debt = kd(1-t)

#### Cost of preferred stock

For nonconvertible, non-ccallable prefereed stock that has a fixed dividend rate and no maturity date, we can use the formula for the cost of a preferred stock:

> Kps = Dps / P

Where: 
- Dps - the preferred stock dividend per share;
- P - the current preferred stock price per share;

#### Cost of common equity

##### CAPM approach

Capital Asset Pricing Model(CAPM)

Kce = Rf + β[E(Rm) - Rf]

Where: 
- Rf: risk-free rate;
- β: beta(systematic risk) of firm's stock
- E(Rm): expected market return
- E(Rm) - Rf: market risk premium(市场的风险溢价)
- Rm: 市场的收益

##### DDM approach(股息折现模型)

Dividend discount model

> Kce = D1/P0 + g

Where:
- D1: **next year's** dividend
- P0: current stock price
- g: firm's expected constant growth rate = (ROE)(retention rate,留存率) = (ROE)(1 - payout ratio，票息)

##### Bond yield plus risk premium

Bond yield plus risk premium approach
> Kce = kd + risk premium

Where:
- kd: before-tax cost of debt
- risk premium: historical spread between stock return and debt return

In developed country, risk premium ranges from 3% to 5%
