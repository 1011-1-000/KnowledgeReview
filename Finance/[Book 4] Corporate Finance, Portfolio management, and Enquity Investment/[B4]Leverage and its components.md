### Leverage and its components

#### Leverage definition

A given change in one variable leads to a greater change in other variable because of **fixed cost**

- Operating leverage: created by fixed operating cost(depreciation and rent)
- Financial leverage: created by fixed financial cost(interest)

Leverage increases the volatility of a company's earnings and cash flows(both up and down), and increases the **risk** of lending to(creditors) or owning a company(shareholders

#### Risk decomposition

Business risk(EBIT volatility): the risk associated with operating earning, and is the combination of sales risk and operating risk.
- Sales risk: uncertainty with respect to the price and quantity of goods and services
- Operating risk: risk attributed to the use of fixed cost in operation

The greater the fixed operating costs relative to variable operating costs, the greater the operating risk

Financial risk: the risk associated with how a company finances its operations
- The more fixed-cost financial obligations(eg.debt),the greater the financial risk
