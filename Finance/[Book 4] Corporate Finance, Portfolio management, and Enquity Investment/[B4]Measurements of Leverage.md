### Measurements of Leverage

#### Degree of operating leverage(DOL)

DOL is a quantitative measure of operating risk

> DOL = percentage change in EBIT / percentage change in sales
> DOL = Q(P-V)/Q(P-V)-F = Contribution Margin / (Contribution Margin - F) = (EBIT + F) / EBIT

if EBIT is positive and fixed operating cost is greater than 0, DOL is greater than 1

#### Degree of financial leverage(DFL)

DFL is a quantitative measure of financial risk
> DOL = percentage change in NI / percentage change in EBIT = EBIT /(EBIT - Int.)

- if interest is greater than 0, DFL is greater than 1
- DFL is no affected by the tax rate because tax is not fixed cost.

#### Degree of total leverage(DTL)

A combination of DOL and DFL

DTL = DOL * DFL = Q(P-V)/[Q(P-V) - F - Int.]

#### Effecct of financial leverage on NI and ROE

The use of financial leverage will:

- Reduce the net income due to interest payment;
- Result in higher return of equity, and higher volatility of ROE, eg.increase both potential return and risk to the common shareowners.

#### Breakeven point

Breakeven point(Q): quantity of sales at which the company's net income is zero.
> Q = Fixed cost / Unit Contribution Margin = F + I /(P -V)

Operating breakeven point: quantity of sales at which the company's operating income is zero.
> Q = F /(P-V)

The effect of leverage on breakeven point:
- All else equal, a firm with higher leverage owns higher breakeven point
- The further unit sales are from the breakeven point for high-leverage companies, the greater the magnifying effect of leverage
