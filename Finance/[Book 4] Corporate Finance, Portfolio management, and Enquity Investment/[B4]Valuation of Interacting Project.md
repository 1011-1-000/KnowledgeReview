### Valuation of Interacting Project

Project interaction

Independent projects: projects are unrelated to each other
- Unlimited funds: the firm can raise the funds it wants for all profitable projects

Mutually exclusive projects: projects complete directly with each other
- Capital rationing: the firm has a fixed amount of funds to invest

Project sequencing: projects should be taken in time order


#### Independent projects

Accept all projects with NPV > 0(IRR > cost of capital, PI > 1)

#### Mutual exclusive projects

- NPV method: choose the one with highest NPV
- IRR method: choose the one with highest IRR
- PI method: choose the one with highest PI

NPV and IRR project rankings may conflict due to:
- Different sizes of CFs
- Different timing of CFs
- Different reinvestment rate assumptions: NPV assumes CFs can reinvest at the cost of capital(more conservative/realistic), IRR assumes CFs can reinvest at project's IRR.

**If the conflict is happened, we should choose the project with higher NPV**

#### NPV profile

A conventional cash flow project's NPV graphed as a function of various discount rates

Crossover rate: NPV of project A and B are equal at one point of the discount rate.

#### NPV and stock price

NPV is a direct measure of the expected change in shareholder wealth from a project.Theoretically:
- A project with positive NPV will increase the wealth of shareholder and stock price
- A project with negative NPV will decrease the wealth of shareholder and stock price

**Changes in stock price = NPV / number of shares**
