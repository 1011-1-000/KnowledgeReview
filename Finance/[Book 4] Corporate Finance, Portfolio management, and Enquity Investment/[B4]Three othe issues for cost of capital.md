### Three other issues for cost of capital

#### Cost of capital in developing country

Problem: Empirical studies show that beta does not adequately capture country risk for companies in developing countries.

Solution: Adding a country risk premium(CRP) to the market risk premium when using the CAPM to estimate the cost of equity

> Kce = Rf + β[E(Rm) - Rf + CRP]

Calculation of CRP:

CRP = sovereign yield spread * [Annualized standard deviation of equity index of developing country / Annualized standard deviation of sovereign bond market in terms of the developed market currency]

sovereign yield spread: difference between the yield of goverment bonds in the developing country, denominated in the currency of a developed country and Treasury bonds yield with similar maturity in the developed country.

#### Marginal cost of capital schedule

In reality, the marginal cost of capital curve is not as smooth as we learned before, instead, it is a upward-sloping step-up cost schedule.

##### Break point

The amount of capital at which the WACC changes, which means that the cost of one of the sources of capital change.

Break point = Amount of capital at which the source's cost of capital changes / Proportion of new capital raised from the source


#### Flotation cost(发行费用)

The fee charged by investment bankers when a company raises additional capital.
- For debt and preferred stock, flotation cost is quite small(<1%), and usually do not incorporate in the estimated cost of capital
- For equity, the flotation cost may be substantial, and should be considered when estimating the cost of external equity capital

Right way: deduct the flotation cost from the initial cash flow of projects
