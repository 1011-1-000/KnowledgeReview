### Weighted Average cost of capital

#### Cost of capital

The rate of return that the supplier of capital require as compensation for their contribution of capital, or the opportunity cost of funds for the suppliers of capital

Alternative to raise capital(融资方式):
- Debt
- Common equity
- Preferred stock

Cost of capital of a company:

The required rate of return that investors demand for the average-risk investment of a company

The most common way to estimate the cost of capital of a company is weighted average cost of capital(WACC),**which is to calculate the margin costs of each sources of capital** and then calculate a weighted average of these costs

WACC also refers to the company's marginal cost of capital(MCC)

#### Weighted Average cost of capital(WACC)

WACC = Wd * Kd * (1-t) + Wps * Kps + Wce * Kce

w = the proportion of each resource for the company to raises new funds, and should be base on the **market value**

- Kd = the before-tax marginal cost of debt
- Kps = the marginal cost of preferred stock
- Kce = the marginal cost of common equity
- t = the company's marginal tax rate

#### Tax & Cost of capital

Interest on debt financing is a deduction to arrive at taxable income, so the before-tax cost on new debt need to be adjusted by  a factor 0f (1-t).

**Keep other factors constant, the higher the tax rate, the lower the debt cost, the lower the WACC**

#### Weight of WACC

- if a target capital structure is available, use this target capital structure
- if target capital structure is not available, estimate weights using one of the several approaches:

> - the company's current capital structure
> - Infer the target capital structure by trends in the company's capital structure or statements by management
> - User averages of comparable companies' capital structure

#### Application of cost of capital

- Capital-budgeting decision making:Decide the optimal capital budget, Calculate the NPV of a projecct(as discount rate)
- Security valuation using DCF models(as discount rate)
- Optimal capital budget: the intersection of MCC curve and IOS curve

Marginal cost of capital(MCC): The cost of an additional dollar of capital.MCC generally increases as the firm increases the capital raised

Investment opportunity schedule(IOS): returns to a company's investment opportunities generally decrease as the company make additional investments.

The WACC or MCC，adjusted appropriately for the risk of a given project, plays a role in capital-budgeting decision making based on the NPV of that projecct.

When using the company's WACC as discount rate in the calculation of the NPV of a project, there are two implied assumptions:
- The project has the average-risk of the company; if project's risk > average-risk(WACC): discount rate will be underestimated, and NPV will be overestimated. if project's risk < average-risk(WACC):discount rate will be overestimated, and NPV will underestimated.
- The company will have a constant target capital structure throughout its useful life
