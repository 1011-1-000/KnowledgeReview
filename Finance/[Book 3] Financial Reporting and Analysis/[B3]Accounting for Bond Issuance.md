#### Accounting for Bond Issuance

##### Bond Terminology

- Face Value(面值)：maturity value or par value, is the amount of principal that will be paid to the bondholder at maturity.

- Coupon rate(票面利率): The interest rate stated in the bond that is used to calculate the coupon payments.(年化利率)。

- Coupon payments: Periodic interest payment.

- Effecctive interest rate(有效利率)：
	> B/P(begin) + Interest Expense - Coupon payments（Face value * coupon rate） = B/P(ending)

- Interest expense(财务费用)：Reported in the income statement is calculaed by multipling the book balue of the bond liability at the begining of the period by the market rate of interest of the bond when it was issued.

- Bond liability: Liability of a bond is equal to the present value of its remaining cash flows， discounted at the market rate of interest at issuance.(需对债券进行定价)。

##### Issuance of bond

At the date of issuance, the market rate of interest may be equal to, less than, or greater than coupon rate.

- when the market rate is equal to the coupon rate, the bond is a par bond(priced at face value,平价发行债券)

- when the market rate is greater than the coupon rate the bond is a discount bond(priced below par, 折价发行债券)

- when the market rate is less than the coupon rate, the bond is a premium bond(priced above par, 溢价发行债券，coupon rate 会相应比较高)

###### 平价发行债券

- 在资产负债表中：期初和期末， bond liability 是不会发生改变的.
- 在利润表中：Interest expense for the period is equal to the coupon payment because the yield at issuance and the coupon rate are the same.
- 在现金流量表中：The issue proceeds are reported as a cash inflow from financing activities and the coupon payments are reported as cash outflows from operating activities under GAAP, they may be reported as CFO or CFF under IFRS.

The bond liability remains at face value over the life of the bond.

##### 折价发行债券

- coupon rate < market interest rate

- 零息债券是指到期之前没有coupon payments.

##### 溢价发行债券

- The bond liability will decrease towards the face value over the life of the bond.
- Interest expense < Coupon payment, the amortization of premium will reduce the interest expense shown on I/S

##### A important conclusion.

In terms of the premium bond, Without adjustment, CFO is understated and CFF is oversated. if in issue the bond at discount, CFO is overstated and CFF is understated.
