#### Issuance Costs & Derecongnition of Debt

##### Issuance Costs

Issuing a bond involves legal and accounting fees, printing costs, sales commissions, and other fees.(金融危机实际是去中心化)

- Under GAAP, issuance costs are **capitalized** as an asset(deferred charge) and allocated to the income statement as an expense over the term of the bond.
- Under IFRS, the initial bond liability on the balance sheet is reduced by the amount of issuance costs, increasing the bond's effective interest rate. In effect, issuance costs are treated as unanmortized discount.

eg.

Company C issued a $1 million bond for 990,000 with an issuance cost of $10,000

GAAP | IFRS 
---|---|
Assets: Cash $980,000.Issuance cost: $10,000 | Assets: Cash $980,000
Liabilities: Bond payable $990,000 | Liabilities: Bond payable $980,000

A firm reacquires $1 million face value bonds at 102% of par when the carring value of the bond liability is $995,000

A:
- Losses = $1,020,000 - $995,000 = $25,000 recognize in I/S
- Under GAAP, any unamortized issuance costs must be written off and included in the gain or loss calcilation.
- G/L on repurchase = B/S carrying value - Cash paid - Unamortized issuance costs
