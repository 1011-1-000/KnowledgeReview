#### Accounting for lease

租赁的原因

租赁的分类

- Operating lease(经营性租赁)，对承租人而言，No assets and libility is reported by the lessee.只需要在利润表中添加租金一项即可。
- 融资性租赁（Finance lease/Capital lease）,对承租人来说，在你资产和负债的两端会同时增加。同时也意味着会额外增加折旧费用和利息费用。

从出租人的角度来说，承租人的经营性租赁一定是经营性租赁。而承租人的融资性租赁根据两个条件有不同的分类：

- 在计量时的成本是可靠的
- 租金是可以收回来的

如果这两个条件都满足则是融资性租赁，若是不满足则是经营性租赁。而此时的融资性租赁又可以分为两类(在国际准则下是不做区分的)：

- Sales type lease，制造资产并转租给别人，会有Revenue和COGS（制造性企业）
- Direct financing lease, 从别人那买来的资产并转租给别人（金融租赁公司），没有毛利。


Statements | Sales-type lease | Direct-financing lease
---|---|---|
At Inception of I/S | Gross profit = Sales - COGS | No Gross profit is recognized
At Inception of B/S | Lease receivable = PV of lease payments + PV of salvage value | Lease receivable = cost of the assets
Periodic I/S | Interest income = Implicit interest rate * Beginning lease receivable | Interest income
At Inception of CFS | No effect | No effect
Periodic CFS | CFO/CFI | CFO/CFI

在早期，Direct financing lease 的利润会高于经营性租赁。

##### Supplement:

融资性租赁(U.S.GAAP):
- Title transfer
- Bargain purchase option
- The lease period is at lease **75%** of the asset's economic life.
- The present value of the lease payments is equal to or greater than **90%** of the fair value of the leased asset

融资性租赁(IFRS):
- Title transfer
- Bargain purchase option
- The lease term is for the major part of the economic life of the asset
- At the inception of the lease the present value of the minimus lease payments amounts to at least sustantially all of the fair value of the leased asset
- A specialized nature

其他不符合的为经营性租赁。

Statements | Finance lease | Operating lease
---|---|---|
Inception of B/S | Lease asset = Leased liability = PV of lease payments | No effect
Periodic B/S | Leased asset:Depreciation over the lease term. Lease liability: Anmortized cost| No effect
Periodic payments I/S | Recognize interest expense and depreciation expense in income statement | Recognized as rental expense
CFS | Interest expense: CFO, Princple repayment: CFF | CFO
