#### Calculation for income Tax Expense

##### Accounting Base & Tax Base - Assets

- Depreciable assets(DTL)

	> Accounting base = Original cost - accumulated accounting depreciation

	> Tax base = Original cost - accumulated tax depreciation

- R&D(DTA)
	
	> Accounting base(Expensed as incurred) = Zero

	> Tax base(Capitalized) = Original cost - accumulated amortization

- Account receivable(DTA)

	> Accounting base = invoiced amount(开票金额) - allowance for bad debt

	> Tax base = invoiced amount(do not recognize allowance) 


##### Accounting Base & Tax Base - Liabilities

- Customer advance(DTA)

	> Accounting base(accrual accounting) = unearned revenue treat as a liability

	> Tax base(cash accounting) = Revenue is recognized no liability arise = Zero

- Warranty liability(DTA)

	> Accounting base(accrual accounting) = A liability is recognized for future obligation

	> Tax base(cash accounting) = Recognize a expense when a cash outflow incurred = Zero

##### Measurement of income tax expense

Income tax expense = current tax expense + △DTL - △DTA

- 注意的是，DTL和DTA的计算是用未来的tax rate来计算
- current tax expense 应该用现在的tax rate来计算

##### Tax rate changes

当税率发生变化时：

New DTA or DTL = Old DTA or DTL * (New tax rate / Old tax rate)
