#### Calculation For Deffered Tax

##### Balance sheet approach

Calculate the difference between two bases:

- For assets = accounting base - tax base
- For liabilities = ( - accounting base ) - ( - tax base )

Positive figure * tax rate = DTL
Negative figure * tax rate = DTA

一般来说，折旧都属于DTL,而在其他的场景下基本上都属于DTA

Tax base = cost - accumulated tax allowable depreciation
Accounting base = Carrying value = cost - accumulated accounting depreciation

##### Income Statement approach

不推荐，速度较慢。
